## Documentation

For developers and advanced users, see the [docs](docs/) folder for detailed guides on USP, CFG, FSDP, and expansion modules.
- Top most head is `dev`, pr merge into `dev` or any custom branch name e.g `komikndr:raylight/feat-something` <- `john_doe:raylight/feat-something`, DONT MERGE INTO MAIN
- If commit message contain "Partial: " it meaant the code is finished, tested on single worker, but not yet being tested in parallel setup.

## What exactly is Raylight

Raylight is a parallelism node for ComfyUI, where the tensor of an image or video sequence
is split among GPU ranks. Raylight, as its partial namesake, uses [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html)
to manage its GPU workers. [Introduction to Raylight on Youtube](https://youtu.be/KQxrkJAV4eI?si=JHjZAKZ3RGBCtmFx)

<img width="834" height="1276" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a79e980-1111-4e31-b6cb-7b6ff35eb766" />

So how does it split among the ranks? It uses Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), embedded inside
[XDiT](https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT), a core library of Raylight that splits and allgathers tensors among GPU ranks.

Unfortunately, although it splits across GPUs, each GPU must still load the full model weight.
And let's be honest, most of us do not have a 4090 or 5090. In my opinion, buying a second 4070
is monetarily less painful than buying a 5090. This is where [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) comes in.
Its job is to split the model weights among GPUs.

**TLDR:** Raylight is multi-GPU nodes for Comfy, USP for splitting the work, and FSDP for splitting the model weights.

### Raylight vs MultiGPU vs ComfyUI Worksplit branch vs ComfyUI-Distributed
- [MultiGPU](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU)
  Loads models selectively on specified GPUs without sharing workload.
  Includes CPU RAM offloading, which also benefits single-GPU users.

- [ComfyUI Worksplit branch](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/7063)
  Splits workload at the CFG level, not at the tensor level.
  Since most workflows use `CFG=1.0` like Wan with Lora, this approach provides limited use cases.

- [ComfyUI-Distributed](https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed)
  Distribute jobs among workers. Run your workflow on multiple GPUs simultaneously with varied seeds.
  Easily connect to local/remote/cloud worker like RunPod.

- **Raylight**
  Provides both tensor split in sequence parallelism (USP), CFG parallelism and model weight sharding (FSDP).
  Your GPUs will 100% being used at the same time. In technical sense it _combine your VRAM_.
  This enables efficient multi-GPU utilization and scales beyond single high-memory GPUs (e.g., RTX 4090/5090).

## RTM and Known Issues
- Scroll further down for the installation guide.
- Models without new ComfyUI quantization usually can be sharded using FSDP.
- If there is an error about NCCL installation, install `nvidia-nccl-cu12==2.28.9`:
  ```bash
  pip install nvidia-nccl-cu12==2.28.9
  ```
  Raylight uses this NCCL library instead of the NCCL bundled with PyTorch.
- By default, Ray workers use NCCL's normal transport selection, so P2P and shared-memory
  transports remain available when supported. Set the following variables to 1 only for
  troubleshooting to disable those transports if NCCL initialization or watchdog failures occur:
  ```bash
  export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1
  export NCCL_SHM_DISABLE=1
  ```
  Raylight can run with these settings, but they may hurt performance. Treat them as a
  sanity check to confirm whether Raylight can run, not as recommended defaults.
- Raylight has not been tested with InfiniBand or RoCE. If your system uses either, adjust
  NCCL networking settings as needed. For systems without InfiniBand/RDMA, this can be used
  for troubleshooting:
  ```bash
  export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1
  ```
- Ray workers remove `backend:cudaMallocAsync` from their inherited
  `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` by default. This avoids allocator-related OOMs during
  NCCL collectives while leaving the ComfyUI host process unchanged. To preserve
  `cudaMallocAsync` in Ray workers:
  ```bash
  export RAYLIGHT_KEEP_CUDA_MALLOC_ASYNC=1
  ```
  Other allocator options, such as `expandable_segments:True`, are preserved.
- Example WF just open from your comfyui menu and browse templates
- **GPU Topology** is very important, not all PCIe in your motherboard is equal.
- VRAM leakage, when using [Ring > 1 instead of Ulysses](https://github.com/feifeibear/long-context-attention/issues/112).
  Solution : just increase Ulysses degree for now.
- The PyTorch **NCCL** version will be replaced to `2.28.9` to fix issues with FP8 communication.
- The PyTorch version will be `2.8.1` due to relaxed `dtype` constraints when using FSDP. You can still use `2.7.1`
  or earlier. However, FSDP will not function correctly in those versions.
- Intel XPU uses `ZE_AFFINITY_MASK` for per-worker device pinning, prefers the native `xccl`
  backend when available (commonly on newer PyTorch XPU builds such as 2.7+), and otherwise falls back to `ccl` via
  `oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch` before finally falling back to `gloo`.
- Intel XPU currently runs with PyTorch SDPA attention only. Flash-attn/yunchang kernels and
  the `cudagraphs` torch.compile backend remain CUDA-only. FSDP CPU offload on XPU should be
  treated as experimental.

## Operation

### Mode

**Sequence Parallel**
This mode splits the sequence among GPUs, the full model will be loaded into each GPU.
Use the XFuser KSampler to increase the Ulysses degree according to the number of your GPUs,
while keeping the Ring degree at 1 for small systems.

![USP](docs/images/USP.PNG)

---

**Data Parallel**
The full sequence will be processed independently on each GPU.
Use the Data Parallel KSampler. There are two options, enable FSDP, or disable all options in `Ray Init Actor`.
By disabling them, it will run in DP mode. Both FSDP and DP modes must have the Ulysses and Ring degrees set to
0.

FSDP will shard the weights, but each GPU will still work independently,
as the name suggests, Fully Sharded (Weight) Data Parallel.


Data parallel also can use different prompt per generation using Conditional List

![DP](docs/images/DP.PNG)
![DP_COND_FSDP](docs/images/DP_DPCOND_FSDP.PNG)

---

**Sequence + FSDP**
Activate FSDP, and set the Ulysses degree to the number of GPUs. Use the XFuser KSampler.

![USP_FSDP](docs/images/USP_FSDP.PNG)

---

**Unified Parallel**
This is experimental mode where all type of parallel group can work at a sime time, USP, FSDP, DP, CFG.

![UNIFIED](docs/images/UNIFIED.PNG)
![UNIFIED_DP_COND](docs/images/UNIFIED_DP_COND.PNG)

---


### Side Notes
- **Rule of thumb**, if you have enough VRAM, just use USP, if not, enable the FSDP, and if that is still not enough,
  enable also the FSDP CPU Offload.
- FSDP CPU Offload is intended for systems with very low VRAM, though it will come with a performance hit work akin to
  DisTorch from MultiGPU.
- From `1.6.0` version Raylight will piggy back on ComfyUI Aimdo for non FSDP workload. To disable Aimdo add cli `--disable-dynamic-vram`

## GPU Architectures

### NVidia

1. **Volta** : Use latest Yunchang libs, check notes below.
2. **Turing**: Same as Volta
3. **Ampere**: Tested
4. **Ada Lovelace**: Tested
5. **Blackwell**: Tested

### AMD

1. **MI3XX** : User confirmed working on 8xMI300X using ROCm compiled PyTorch and Flash Attention 2.
2. **MI210** : Personally tested and working on MI210 using ROCm compiled PyTorch and builtin `torch.nn.Functional.SDPA`

### Intel
1. **Arc Pro B60** : Using [LLM Scaler](https://github.com/intel/llm-scaler/blob/main/omni/README.md/#wan22).
2. Native Intel XPU support is available through `torch.xpu` / IPEX-style PyTorch builds.
3. Use PyTorch **2.5+** as the baseline for `torch.xpu` support. Raylight checks for native
   `xccl` support at runtime and uses it when available; on many XPU builds that is typically
   PyTorch **2.7+**, but the actual capability check is runtime-based rather than version-locked.
4. Install hint:
   ```bash
   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
   ```
5. To restrict workers to specific Intel GPUs manually, set `ZE_AFFINITY_MASK`. When you use
   `GPU_SELECT`, Raylight pins each worker to one selected Intel GPU with its own per-worker
   `ZE_AFFINITY_MASK` value instead of treating it like a CUDA-style comma-separated mask.
6. Known XPU limitations:
   - xFuser attention must use the PyTorch SDPA/TORCH backend.
   - `torch.compile(..., backend="cudagraphs")` is CUDA-only; use `inductor`.
   - FSDP CPU offload support on XPU is not well-tested yet.

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Supported
- ❌ = Not currently supported.
- ✅† = Code-ready, awaiting ControlNet model weights.
- ❓ = Logically supported, awaiting for testing.
- T = Text
- I = Image
- A = Audio
- V = Video

**Notes:**
- Non standard Wan variant (Phantom, etc...) is not tested
- CFG parallel for Flux, Hunyuan, is technically supported by Raylight,
  but since these models do not support conditional batches (CFG = 1), enabling it has no effect.
- Chroma and Hunyuan Video ControlNet support is implemented in the USP/FSDP code paths
  but no ControlNet model weights are currently available in ComfyUI to test with.
- Only one ControlNet model per workflow is supported. To apply the same model with
  different images or strengths, use multiple Apply ControlNet (Ray) nodes connected
  to a single Load ControlNet (Ray) node.

**Notes:**
- **RTX 2000 ADA ≈ RTX 4060 Ti** in performance.
- All benchmarks were executed using **ComfyUI native workflows**, with **no Kijai wrapper** involved.
- **Wan 2.1 14B T2V (FSDP)** is only applicable to **dual RTX 2000 ADA**:
  - **Single RTX 2000 ADA:** OOM
  - **5090:** does not require FSDP
- Results represent the **average of 5 runs**, after warm-up.
- **All speeds are normalized to seconds per iteration (s/it).**
  For models reporting **iterations per second**, we compute `1 / (it/s)` to convert.
- **RTX 2000 ADA topology:** P2P is supported but runs over **SYS** path (NUMA cross-socket),
  meaning **no NVLink is present** and peer bandwidth is reduced.

## Installation

**Manual**
1. Clone this repository under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`.
2. `cd raylight`
3. Install dependencies:
   your_python_env - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Install `pip install nvidia-nccl-cu12==2.28.9`, this is only needed if you are using FSDP with fp8 models with Nvidia GPUs
5. For Intel XPU builds, install an XPU-enabled PyTorch first:
   ```bash
   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
   ```
   If your PyTorch build does not expose native `xccl`, also install `oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch` so
   distributed workers can fall back to the `ccl` backend.
6. Install FlashAttention 2 (optional, CUDA/ROCm only):
   - Option A (NOT recommended due to long build time):
     pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
   - Option B (recommended, use prebuilt wheel):
     For Torch 2.8:
       ```bash
       wget https://github.com/mjun0812/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels/releases/download/v0.3.14/flash_attn-2.8.2+cu128torch2.7-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl -O flash_attn-2.8.2+cu128torch2.7-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
       ```
       ```bash
       pip install flash_attn-2.8.2+cu128torch2.7-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl`
       ```
     For other versions, check:
        https://github.com/mjun0812/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels/releases/
7. Attention backend can be install like any other libs e.g: SageAttn, AITER, FA3 (optional)
   but Intel XPU should stay on the default TORCH/SDPA backend.
8. Use `ZE_AFFINITY_MASK` if you want to pin a process to a specific Intel GPU. For multi-worker
   Raylight runs, prefer `GPU_SELECT` so each worker gets its own per-worker XPU affinity mask.
9. Restart ComfyUI.

**ComfyUI Manager**
1. Find raylight in the manager and install it.

**Windows**
1. After numerous testing, it still does not work on out of the box PyTorch, however if you want to try:
2. First, build [NCCL](https://github.com/MyCaffe/NCCL) for Windows.
3. Recommended steps:
   - Manually clone the **Raylight** repo
   - Switch to the `dev` branch for now
   - Inside the top-most Raylight folder (where `pyproject.toml` exists), run:

   ```bash
   ..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt
   ..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -e .
   ```
4. Advice, just run in WSL, and symlink your ComfyUI model dir from windows to WSL.
